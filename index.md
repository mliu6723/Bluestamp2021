# Cough Detection
This project dealt with using a machine learning model in order to accurately detect coughs and sneezes in the vicinity. Not only is this useful for the current pandemic, but it can also be applied for entertainment purposes. In this project, I modified the original design in order to activate a spray bottle whenever the model hears a sneeze in order to create a 4D viewing experinece.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
For the first week, I needed to not only get an understanding of arduino and the hardware but also start on the software of the project. The machine learning aspect of the project is definitely the most difficult and this week, I have essentially finished training my model. The biggest challenge in doing this is likely finding usable data sets that were most effective in training the model. Often they were either too big or too small and finding one that worked effectively was not easy. However, I ultimately settled on a data set and achieved the first milestone of having a working machine learning model to identify coughs. However, it does not yet identify sneezes well and will be something I need to obtain more data for.
